# Enable Zephyr runner options which request mass erase if so
# configured.
#
# Note that this also disables the default "leave" option when
# targeting STM32 DfuSe devices with dfu-util, making the chip stay in
# the bootloader after flashing.
#
# That's the right thing, because mcuboot has nothing to do since the
# chip was just erased. The next thing the user is going to want to do
# is flash the application. (Developers can reset DfuSE devices
# manually to test mcuboot behavior on an otherwise erased flash
# device.)
