# Image tool

You can manage keys and sign images using the Python program
`scripts/imgtool.py`.

This program is written in Python3 and has several dependencies on Python
libraries. You can install the required dependencies using `pip3`:

```
    pip3 install --user -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

## [Managing keys](#managing-keys)

This tool currently supports rsa-2048, rsa-3072, ecdsa-p256, and ed25519
keys. You can generate a keypair for one of these types using the `keygen`
command: ``` ./scripts/imgtool.py keygen -k filename.pem -t <keytype> ```

`<keytype>` can be either `rsa-2048`,`rsa-3072`, `ecdsa-p256`, or
`ed25519`. The key type used should match what MCUboot is configured to
verify.

---
***Note***

*This key file (`filename.pem` in the example above) is used to sign images.*
*As such, it must be protected and not widely distributed.*

---

To make `keygen` prompt for a password, add the `-p` argument to the
command, followed by the desired password. You will need to input this
password every time you will use the private key.

## [Incorporating the public key into the code](#incorporating-the-public-key-into-the-code)

There is a development key distributed with MCUboot that can be used for
testing. Once you have generated a production key, as described above, you
should replace the public key in the bootloader with the generated one.

---
***Note***

*The development key is widely distributed.*
*Never use it for production.*

---

For Zephyr, the keys live in the file `boot/zephyr/keys.c`.

>>>TODO

For mynewt, follow the instructions in `docs/signed_images.md` to generate
the key file.

The following command will extract the public key from the given private
key file, and output it as a C data structure:

```
    ./scripts/imgtool.py getpub -k filename.pem
```

You can replace or insert this code into the key file. However, when the
`MCUBOOT_HW_KEY` config option is enabled, this last step is unnecessary
and can be skipped.

## [Signing images](#signing-images)

When signing an image, imgtool takes an image, in binary or Intel HEX
format, intended for the primary slot and adds a header and trailer that
the bootloader is expecting.

To sign an image, use the following command:

```
imgtool.py sign [OPTIONS] INFILE OUTFILE
```

`INFILE` and `OUTFILE` are parsed as Intel HEX if the parameters have an
.hex extension, otherwise, the binary format is used.

See below for a list of the available options:

```
    Options:
      -k, --key filename
      --public-key-format [hash|full]
      --align [1|2|4|8]             [required]
      -v, --version TEXT            [required]
      -s, --security-counter TEXT   Specify the value of security counter. Use
                                    the `auto` keyword to automatically generate
                                    it from the image version.
      -d, --dependencies TEXT
      --pad-sig                     Add 0-2 bytes of padding to ECDSA signature
                                    (for mcuboot <1.5)
      -H, --header-size INTEGER     [required]
      --pad-header                  Add --header-size zeroed bytes at the
                                    beginning of the image
      -S, --slot-size INTEGER       Size of the slot where the image will be
                                    written [required]
      --pad                         Pad image to --slot-size bytes, adding
                                    trailer magic
      --confirm                     When padding the image, mark it as confirmed
      -M, --max-sectors INTEGER     When padding allow for this amount of
                                    sectors (defaults to 128)
      --boot-record sw_type         Create CBOR encoded boot record TLV. The
                                    sw_type represents the role of the software
                                    component (e.g. CoFM for coprocessor
                                    firmware). [max. 12 characters]
      --overwrite-only              Use overwrite-only instead of swap upgrades
      -e, --endian [little|big]     Select little or big endian
      -E, --encrypt filename        Encrypt image using the provided public key
      --save-enctlv                 When upgrading, save encrypted key TLVs
                                    instead of plain keys. Enable when
                                    BOOT_SWAP_SAVE_ENCTLV config option was set.
      -L, --load-addr INTEGER       Load address for image when it should run
                                    from RAM.
      -x, --hex-addr INTEGER        Adjust address in hex output file.
      -R, --erased-val [0|0xff]     The value that is read back from erased
                                    flash.
      -h, --help                    Show this message and exit.
```

The main arguments given are the key file generated above, a version field
to place in the header (`1.2.3`, for example), the alignment of the flash
device in question, and the header size:

- The header size depends on the operating system and the particular flash
  device. For Zephyr, it is configured as part of the build and is a small
  power of two.

  By default, the Zephyr build system already prepends a zeroed header to
  the image. If another build system is in use that does not automatically
  add this zeroed header, you can pass the `--pad-header` argument to make
  imgtool add the `--header-size` zeroed bytes at the beginning of the
  image.

  If `--pad-header` is used with an Intel Hex file, `--header-size` bytes
  are subtracted from the load address (in Intel Hex terms, the Extended
  Linear Address record) to adjust for the new bytes prepended to the
  file. The load address of all data existing in the file does not change.

- The `--slot-size` argument is required and used to check that the
  firmware does not overflow into the swap status area (metadata). If swap
  upgrades are not being used, `--overwrite-only` can be passed to avoid
  adding the swap status area size when calculating overflow.

- The optional `--pad` argument places a trailer on the image that
  indicates that the image must be considered an upgrade. Writing this image
  in the secondary slot then causes the bootloader to upgrade to it.

- A dependency can be specified as follows:
  ```
  -d "(image_id, image_version)"
  ```

  - The `image_id` is the number of the image which the current image
    depends on.

  - The `image_version` is the minimum version of that image to satisfy
    compliance.

  For example, `-d "(1, 1.2.3+0)"` means this image depends on `image 1`
  that has to be at least version `1.2.3+0`.

- The `--public-key-format` argument can be used to distinguish where the
  public key is stored for image authentication. The `hash` option is used
  by default, in which case only the hash of the public key is added to the
  TLV area (the full public key is incorporated into the bootloader).

  When the `full` option is used instead, the TLV area will contain the
  whole public key and thus the bootloader can be independent from the
  key(s). For more information on the additional requirements of this
  option, see the [design](design.md) document.
