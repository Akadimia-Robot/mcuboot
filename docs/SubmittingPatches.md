# Patch submission

Development on MCUboot takes place in the [MCUboot GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot).

Changes must be submitted via GitHub pull requests.
Each commit should have a "Signed-off-by" line mentioning the author (and the committer, if that is different).
It is not necessary (or possible) to get a "Signed-off-by" from Github itself, even though some commits may be generated by that tool.

The Signed-off-by line should be at the end of the commit text, in the last blank-line-separated section.
There can be multiple lines in this section, as the format is similar to RFC-2822.
Currently, the supported trailer lines are structured as follows:

- A line that indicates that the signer agrees to the "Developer Certificate of Origin" located at the bottom of this page:
  ```
      Signed-off-by: Developer Name <devname@example.com>
  ```

- A line that associate this commit with specific JIRA tickets.
  ```
      JIRA: MCUB-1234, MCUB-5678
  ```

  You can mention more than one JIRA ticket, by separating them using a comma and a space.
  JIRA is quite flexible about where the indicators go, but putting them in a trailer with a common format will make them easier to find later.

## Developer certificate of origin

The following is the "Developer Certificate of Origin":
