# Bootloader design

This document describes the design of MCUboot.

## [Summary](#summary)

MCUboot is composed of two packages:

* The bootutil library (boot/bootutil)
* The boot application (each port has its own at `boot/<port>`)

The bootutil library performs most of the functions of a bootloader,
except the final step of actually jumping to the main image. This last
step is instead implemented by the boot application.

The bootloader functionality is separated in this manner to enable unit
testing of the bootloader. A library can be unit tested, while an
application can't be. Therefore, functionality is delegated to the
bootutil library, when possible.

## [Limitations](#limitations)

The bootloader currently supports only images with the following
characteristics:
* Built to run from flash memory.
* Built to run from a fixed location (namely, not position-independent).
* Built to run from RAM (MCUboot loads the images from the flash memory)

## [Image format](#image-format)

The following definitions describe the image format.

``` c
#define IMAGE_MAGIC                 0x96f3b83d

#define IMAGE_HEADER_SIZE           32

struct image_version {
    uint8_t iv_major;
    uint8_t iv_minor;
    uint16_t iv_revision;
    uint32_t iv_build_num;
};

/** Image header.  All fields are in little endian byte order. */
struct image_header {
    uint32_t ih_magic;
    uint32_t ih_load_addr;
    uint16_t ih_hdr_size;           /* Size of image header (bytes). */
    uint16_t ih_protect_tlv_size;   /* Size of protected TLV area (bytes). */
    uint32_t ih_img_size;           /* Does not include header. */
    uint32_t ih_flags;              /* IMAGE_F_[...]. */
    struct image_version ih_ver;
    uint32_t _pad1;
};

#define IMAGE_TLV_INFO_MAGIC        0x6907
#define IMAGE_TLV_PROT_INFO_MAGIC   0x6908

/** Image TLV header.  All fields in little endian. */
struct image_tlv_info {
    uint16_t it_magic;
    uint16_t it_tlv_tot;  /* size of TLV area (including tlv_info header) */
};

/** Image trailer TLV format. All fields in little endian. */
struct image_tlv {
    uint8_t  it_type;   /* IMAGE_TLV_[...]. */
    uint8_t  _pad;
    uint16_t it_len;    /* Data length (not including TLV header). */
};

/*
 * Image header flags.
 */
#define IMAGE_F_PIC                      0x00000001 /* Not supported. */
#define IMAGE_F_ENCRYPTED_AES128         0x00000004 /* Encrypted using AES128. */
#define IMAGE_F_ENCRYPTED_AES256         0x00000008 /* Encrypted using AES256. */
#define IMAGE_F_NON_BOOTABLE             0x00000010 /* Split image app. */
#define IMAGE_F_RAM_LOAD                 0x00000020

/*

 */
#define IMAGE_TLV_KEYHASH           0x01   /* hash of the public key */
#define IMAGE_TLV_SHA256            0x10   /* SHA256 of image hdr and body */
#define IMAGE_TLV_RSA2048_PSS       0x20   /* RSA2048 of hash output */
#define IMAGE_TLV_ECDSA224          0x21   /* ECDSA of hash output */
#define IMAGE_TLV_ECDSA256          0x22   /* ECDSA of hash output */
#define IMAGE_TLV_RSA3072_PSS       0x23   /* RSA3072 of hash output */
#define IMAGE_TLV_ED25519           0x24   /* ED25519 of hash output */
#define IMAGE_TLV_ENC_RSA2048       0x30   /* Key encrypted with RSA-OAEP-2048 */
#define IMAGE_TLV_ENC_KW            0x31   /* Key encrypted with AES-KW-128 or
                                              256 */
#define IMAGE_TLV_ENC_EC256         0x32   /* Key encrypted with ECIES-P256 */
#define IMAGE_TLV_ENC_X25519        0x33   /* Key encrypted with ECIES-X25519 */
#define IMAGE_TLV_DEPENDENCY        0x40   /* Image depends on other image */
#define IMAGE_TLV_SEC_CNT           0x50   /* security counter */
```

Optional type-length-value records (TLVs) containing image metadata are
placed after the end of the image.

The `ih_protect_tlv_size` field indicates the length of the protected TLV
area. If protected TLVs are present then a TLV info header with magic
equal to `IMAGE_TLV_PROT_INFO_MAGIC` must be present and the protected
TLVs (plus the info header itself) must be included in the hash
calculation. Otherwise, the hash is only calculated over the image header
and the image itself. In this case, the value of the `ih_protect_tlv_size`
field is 0.

The `ih_hdr_size` field indicates the length of the header, and therefore
the offset of the image itself. This field provides for backward
compatibility in case of changes to the format of the image header.

## [Flash map](#flash-map)

A device's flash memory is partitioned according to its _flash map_. At a
high level, the flash map maps numeric IDs to `_flash areas_. A flash
memory area is a region of the disk with the following properties:
1. It can be fully erased without affecting any other areas.
2. A write to this area does not restrict writes to other areas.

The bootloader uses the following flash area IDs:
```c
/* Independent from multiple image boot */
#define FLASH_AREA_BOOTLOADER         0
#define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SCRATCH      3
```
```c
/* If the bootloader is working with the first image */
#define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_PRIMARY      1
#define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SECONDARY    2
```
```c
/* If the bootloader is working with the second image */
#define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_PRIMARY      5
#define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SECONDARY    6
```

The bootloader area contains the bootloader image itself. The other areas
are described in subsequent sections. The flash memory could contain
multiple executable images. Therefore, the flash area IDs of primary and
secondary areas are mapped based on the number of the active image
(namely, the image on which the bootloader is currently working).

## [Image slots](#image-slots)

A portion of the flash memory can be partitioned into multiple image
areas, called "image pairs", where each area contains two image slots:
a primary and a secondary one.

Normally, the bootloader will only run an image from the primary slot, so
images must be built such that they can run from that fixed location in
the flash memory (an exception to this is the [direct-xip](#direct-xip)
and the [ram-load](#ram-load) upgrade mode). If the bootloader needs to
run the image resident in the secondary slot, it must copy its content
into the primary slot before doing so, either by swapping the two images
or by overwriting the content of the primary slot.

The bootloader supports either swap-based or overwrite-based image
upgrades, but must be configured at build time to choose one of these two
strategies.

In addition to the slots of image areas, the bootloader requires a scratch
area to allow for reliable image swapping. The scratch area must have a
size that is big enough to store at least the largest sector that is going
to be swapped. Many devices have small equally sized flash sectors, for
example, 4K, while others have variable sized sectors where the largest
sectors might be 128K or 256K, so the scratch must be big enough to store
that. The scratch is only ever used when swapping firmware, which means
only when doing an upgrade. Given that, the main reason for using a larger
size for the scratch is that flash memory wear will be more evenly
distributed, because a single sector would be written twice the number of
times than using two sectors, for example.

To evaluate the ideal size of the scratch for your use case the following
parameters are relevant:
- the ratio of "image size / scratch size"
- the number of erase cycles supported by the flash memory hardware

The image size is used (instead of slot size) because only the slot's
sectors that are actually used for storing the image are copied. The
image/scratch ratio is the number of times the scratch will be erased on
every upgrade. The number of erase cycles divided by the image/scratch
ratio will give you the number of times an upgrade can be performed before
the device goes out of spec:

```
num_upgrades = number_of_erase_cycles / (image_size / scratch_size)
```

Let's assume, for example, a device with 10000 erase cycles, an image size
of 150K, and a scratch of 4K (usual minimum size of 4K sector devices).
This would result in the following total:

```
10000 / (150 / 4) ~ 267
```

Increasing the scratch to 16K would result in the following:

```
10000 / (150 / 16) ~ 1067
```

There isn't a *best* ratio, as the right size is use-case dependent.
Factors to consider include the number of times a device will be upgraded
both in the field and during development, as well as any desired safety
margin on the manufacturer's specified number of erase cycles. In general,
using a ratio that allows hundreds to thousands of field upgrades in
production is recommended.

### [Equal slots (direct-xip)](#direct-xip)

When the direct-xip mode is enabled, the active image flag is "moved"
between the slots during the image upgrade. Also, in direct-xip mode, the
bootloader can run an image directly from either the primary or the
secondary slot (without having to move/copy it into the primary slot).
Therefore, the image update client, which downloads the new images, must
be aware of which slot contains the active image and which acts as a
staging area. It is also responsible for loading the proper images into
the proper slot.

All this requires that the images are built to be executed from the
corresponding slot. At boot time the bootloader first looks for images in
the slots and then inspects the version numbers in the image headers. It
selects the newest image (having the highest version number) and then
checks its validity (integrity check, signature verification, and so on).
If the image is invalid, MCUboot erases its memory slot and starts to
validate the other image. After successful validation of the selected
image, the bootloader chain-loads it.

An additional "revert" mechanism is also supported. For more information,
read the [corresponding section](#direct-xip-revert).

Handling the primary and secondary slots as equals has its drawbacks.
Since the images are not moved between the slots, the on-the-fly image
encryption and decryption can't be supported. This limitation only applies
to storing the image in an external flash on the device, the transport of
encrypted image data is still feasible.

---
***Note***

*The overwrite and the direct-xip upgrade strategies are substantially*
*simpler to implement than the image swapping strategy, especially since*
*the bootloader must work properly even when it is reset during the middle*
*of an image swap. For this reason, the rest of the document describes its*
*behavior when configured to swap images during an upgrade.*

---

### [RAM loading](#ram-load)

In ram-load mode the slots are equal. Like the direct-xip mode, this mode
also selects the newest image by reading the image version numbers in the
image headers. But instead of executing it in place, the newest image is
copied to the RAM for execution. The load address (namely, the location in
RAM where the image is copied to) is stored in the image header.

The ram-load upgrade mode can be useful when there is no internal flash
memory in the SoC, but there is a big enough internal RAM to hold the
images. Usually, in this case, the images are stored in an external
storage device.

Execution from external storage has some drawbacks (lower execution speed,
image is exposed to attacks) therefore the image is always copied to the
internal RAM before the authentication and execution. The ram-load mode
requires the image to be built to be executed from the RAM address range
instead of the storage device address range. If ram-load is enabled then
the platform must define the following parameters:

```c
#define IMAGE_EXECUTABLE_RAM_START    <area_base_addr>
#define IMAGE_EXECUTABLE_RAM_SIZE     <area_size_in_bytes>
```

For multiple image loads, if multiple ram regions are used, the platform
must define the `MULTIPLE_EXECUTABLE_RAM_REGIONS` flag instead and
implement the following function:

```c
int boot_get_image_exec_ram_info(uint32_t image_id,
                                 uint32_t *exec_ram_start,
                                 uint32_t *exec_ram_size)
```

When ram-load is enabled, the `--load-addr <addr>` option of the `imgtool`
script must also be used when signing the images. This option sets the
`RAM_LOAD` flag in the image header, indicating that the image should be
loaded to the RAM, and also sets the load address in the image header.

The ram-load mode currently does not support the image encryption feature.

## [Boot swap types](#boot-swap-types)

When the device first boots under normal circumstances, there is an
up-to-date firmware image in each primary slot, which MCUboot can validate
and then chain-load. In this case, no image swaps are necessary. During
device upgrades, however, new candidate image(s) is present in the
secondary slot(s), which MCUboot must swap into the primary slot(s) before
booting as discussed above.

Upgrading an old image with a new one by swapping is a two-step process.
In this process, MCUboot performs a "test" swap of the image data in the
flash memory and boots the new image or it will be executed during
operation. The new image can then update the content of the flash memory
at runtime to mark itself "OK", and MCUboot will then still choose to run
it during the next boot. When this happens, the swap is made "permanent".
If this doesn't happen, MCUboot will perform a "revert" swap during the
next boot by swapping the image(s) back into its original location(s) and
attempting to boot the old image(s).

Depending on the use case, the first swap can also be made permanent
directly. In this case, MCUboot will never attempt to revert the images on
the next reset.

Test swaps are supported to provide a rollback mechanism to prevent
devices from becoming "bricked" by bad firmware. If the device crashes
immediately upon booting a new (bad) image, MCUboot will revert to the old
(working) image at the next device reset, rather than booting the bad
image again. This allows device firmware to make test swaps that are made
permanent only after performing a self-test routine.

On startup, MCUboot inspects the content of the flash memory to decide for
each image which of these "swap types" to perform. This decision
determines how it proceeds.

The possible swap types, and their meanings, are the following:

- `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_NONE`: The "usual" or "no upgrade" case. It attempts to
  boot the content of the primary slot.
- `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_TEST`: It boots the content of the secondary slot by
  swapping images. Unless the swap is made permanent, it reverts back on the
  next boot.
- `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_PERM`: Permanently swaps images, and boots the upgraded
  image firmware.
- `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_REVERT`: A previous test swap was not made permanent. It
  swaps back to the old image whose data are now in the secondary slot. If
  the old image marks itself "OK" when it boots, the next boot will have
  swap type `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_NONE`.
- `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_FAIL`: The swap failed because the image to be run is
  not valid.
- `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_PANIC`: Swapping encountered an unrecoverable error.

The "swap type" is a high-level representation of the outcome of the boot.
Subsequent sections describe how MCUboot determines the swap type from the
bit-level content of the flash memory.

### [Revert mechanism in direct-xip mode](#direct-xip-revert)

The direct-xip mode also supports a "revert" mechanism which is the
equivalent of the swap mode's "revert" swap. When the direct-xip mode is
selected it can be enabled with the `MCUBOOT_DIRECT_XIP_REVERT` config
option and an image trailer must also be added to the signed images (the
`--pad` option of the `imgtool` script must be used).

For more information on this, read the [Image Trailer](#image-trailer)
section and the [documentation](imgtool.md) of the `imgtool sign` command.

Making the images permanent (marking them as confirmed in advance) is also
supported, just like in swap mode. The individual steps of the direct-xip
mode's "revert" mechanism are the following:

1. Select the slot which holds the newest potential image.
2. Was the image previously selected to run (during a previous boot)?
    + Yes: Did the image mark itself "OK" (was the self-test successful)?
        + Yes.
            - Proceed to step 3.
        + No.
            - Erase the image from the slot to prevent it from being
              selected again during the next boot.
            - Return to step 1 (the bootloader will attempt to select and
              possibly boot the previous image if there is one).
    + No.
        - Mark the image as "selected" (set the copy_done flag in the
          trailer).
        - Proceed to step 3.
3. Proceed to image validation.

## [Image trailer](#image-trailer)

The bootloader uses metadata stored in the image slots to be
able to determine the current state and what actions should be taken
during the current boot operation. While swapping, some of this metadata
is temporarily copied into and out of the scratch area.

This metadata is located at the end of the image flash areas and is called
an image trailer. An image trailer has the following structure:

```
     0                   1                   2                   3

    ~    Swap status (BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS * min-write-size * 3)    ~
    ~                                                               ~

[*]: Only present if the encryption option is enabled
(`MCUBOOT_ENC_IMAGES`).

The offset immediately following such a record represents the start of the
next flash memory area.

---
***Note***

*`min-write-size` is a property of the flash hardware:*
*- If the hardware allows individual bytes to be written at arbitrary*
*addresses, then `min-write-size` is 1.*
*- If the hardware only allows writes at even addresses, then*
*`min-write-size` is 2, and so on.*

---

An image trailer contains the following fields:

1. Swap status: A series of records that records the progress of an image
   swap. To swap entire images, data are swapped between the two image areas
   one or more sectors at a time, like this:
   - sector data in the primary slot is copied into the scratch, then
     erased.
   - sector data in the secondary slot is copied into the primary slot,
     then erased.
   - sector data in scratch is copied into the secondary slot.

   As it swaps images, the bootloader updates the swap status field in a
   way that allows it to compute how far this swap operation has
   progressed for each sector. The swap status field can thus be used to
   resume a swap operation if the bootloader is halted while a swap
   operation is ongoing and later reset. The `BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS` value
   is the configurable maximum number of sectors MCUboot supports for each
   image. Its value defaults to 128 but allows for either decreasing this
   size, limiting RAM usage, or increasing it in devices that have massive
   amounts of flash memory or very small-sized sectors and thus require a
   bigger configuration to allow for the handling of all slot's sectors.
   The factor of `min-write-size` is due to the behavior of the flash
   memory hardware. The factor of 3 is explained below.

2. Encryption keys: key-encrypting keys (KEKs). These keys are needed for
   image encryption and decryption. See the [encrypted
   images](encrypted_images.md) document for more information.

3. Swap size: When beginning a new swap operation, the total size that
   needs to be swapped (based on the slot with the largest image + TLVs) is
   written to this location for easier recovery in case of a reset while
   performing the swap.

4. Swap info: A single byte that encodes the following information:
    - Swap type: Stored in bits 0-3. Indicating the type of swap operation
      in progress. When MCUboot resumes an interrupted swap, it uses this
      field to determine the type of operation to perform. This field
      contains one of the following values in the table below.
    - Image number: Stored in bits 4-7. It has always 0 value at a
      single-image boot. In the case of a multi-image boot, it indicates
      which image was swapped when the interrupt happened. The same scratch
      area is used during all image swap operations. Therefore this field is
      used to determine which image the trailer belongs to if boot status is
      found on the scratch area when the swap operation is resumed.

```
+ ------------------------- + ----- +
| Name                      | Value |
+ ------------------------- + ----- +
| `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_TEST`     | 2     |
| `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_PERM`     | 3     |
| `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_REVERT`   | 4     |
+ ------------------------- + ----- +

```


5. Copy done: A single byte indicating whether the image in this slot is
   complete (`0x01`=done, `0xff`=not done).

6. Image OK: A single byte indicating whether the image in this slot has
   been confirmed as good by the user (`0x01`=confirmed, `0xff`=not
   confirmed).

7. MAGIC: The following 16 bytes, written in host-byte-order:

``` c
    const uint32_t boot_img_magic[4] = {
        0xf395c277,
        0x7fefd260,
        0x0f505235,
        0x8079b62c,
    };
```

## [Image trailers](#image-trailers)

At startup, the bootloader determines the boot swap type by inspecting the
image trailers. When using the term "image trailers" what is meant is the
aggregate information provided by both image slot trailers.

### [New swaps (non-resumes)](#new-swaps-non-resumes)

For new swaps, MCUboot must inspect a collection of fields to determine
which swap operation to perform.

The image trailers records are structured around the limitations imposed
by the flash memory hardware. As a consequence, they do not have a very
intuitive design, and it is difficult to get a sense of the state of the
device just by looking at the image trailers. It is better to map all the
possible trailer states to the swap types described above via a set of
tables. These tables are reproduced below.

---
***Note***

*An important caveat about the tables described below is that they must be*
*evaluated in the order presented here. Lower state numbers must have a*
*higher priority when testing the image trailers.*

---

```
    State I
                     | primary slot | secondary slot |

     result: BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_REVERT                   |
    -------------------------------------------------'
```

Any of the above three states results in MCUboot attempting to swap
images.

Otherwise, MCUboot does not attempt to swap images, resulting in one of
the other three swap types, as illustrated by State IV.

```
    State IV
                     | primary slot | secondary slot |
    -----------------+--------------+----------------|
               magic | Any          | Any            |
            image-ok | Any          | Any            |
           copy-done | Any          | Any            |
    -----------------+--------------+----------------'
     result: BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_NONE,                    |
             BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_FAIL, or                 |
             BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_PANIC                    |
    -------------------------------------------------'
```

In State IV, when no errors occur, MCUboot will attempt to boot the
content of the primary slot directly, and the result is
`BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_NONE`. If the image in the primary slot is not valid, the
result is `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_FAIL`. If a fatal error occurs during boot, the
result is `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_PANIC`. If the result is either
`BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_FAIL` or `BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_PANIC`, MCUboot hangs rather than
booting an invalid or compromised image.

---
***Note***

*An important caveat to the above is the result when a swap is requested*
*and the image in the secondary slot fails to validate, due to a hashing or*
*signing error. This state behaves as State IV with the extra action of*
*marking the image in the primary slot as "OK", to prevent further attempts*
*to swap.*

---

### [Resumed swaps](#resumed-swaps)

If MCUboot determines that it is resuming an interrupted swap (namely, a
reset occurred mid-swap), it fully determines the operation to resume by
reading the `swap info` field from the active trailer and extracting the
swap type from bits 0-3. The set of tables in the previous section are not
necessary in the resume case.

## [High-level operation](#high-level-operation)

With the terms defined, we can now explore the bootloader's operation.
First, a high-level overview of the boot process is presented. Then, the
following sections describe each step of the process in more detail.

Procedure:

1. Inspect swap status region; is an interrupted swap being resumed?
    + Yes: Complete the partial swap operation; skip to step 3.
    + No: Proceed to step 2.

2. Inspect image trailers; is a swap requested?
    + Yes:
        1. Is the requested image valid (integrity and security check)?
            + Yes.
                a. Perform swap operation.
                b. Persist completion of swap procedure to image trailers.
                c. Proceed to step 3.
            + No.
                a. Erase the invalid image.
                b. Persist failure of swap procedure to image trailers.
                c. Proceed to step 3.

    + No: Proceed to step 3.

3. Boot into the image in the primary slot.

### [Multiple image boot](#multiple-image-boot)

When the flash memory contains multiple executable images, the
bootloader's operation is a bit more complex but still similar to the
previously described procedure with one image. As every image can be
updated independently, the flash memory is partitioned further to arrange
two slots for each image.

```
+--------------------+
| MCUBoot            |
+--------------------+
        ~~~~~            <- memory might be not contiguous
+--------------------+
| Image 0            |
| primary   slot     |
+--------------------+
| Image 0            |
| secondary slot     |
+--------------------+
        ~~~~~            <- memory might be not contiguous
+--------------------+
| Image N            |
| primary   slot     |
+--------------------+
| Image N            |
| secondary slot     |
+--------------------+
| Scratch            |
+--------------------+
```

MCUBoot can also handle dependencies between images. For example, if an
image needs to be reverted it might be necessary to revert another one too
(namely due to API incompatibilities) or simply to prevent it from being
updated because of an unsatisfied dependency. Therefore all aborted swaps
have to be completed and all the swap types have to be determined for each
image before the dependency checks. See the following section for more
details on dependency handling.

The multi-image boot procedure is organized in loops that iterate over all
the firmware images. The high-level overview of the boot process is
presented below.

+  Loop 1. Iterate over all images
    1. Inspect swap status region of the current image; is an interrupted
       swap being resumed?
        + Yes:
            + Review the validity of previously determined swap types of
              other images.
            + Complete the partial swap operation.
            + Mark the swap type as `None`.
            + Skip to the next image.
        + No: Proceed to step 2.
    2. Inspect image trailers in the primary and secondary slot; is an
       image swap requested?
        + Yes: Review the validity of previously determined swap types of
          other images.
          Is the requested image valid (integrity and security check)?
            + Yes:
                + Set the previously determined swap type for the current
                  image.
                + Skip to the next image.
            + No:
                + Erase the invalid image.
                + Persist failure of swap procedure to image trailers.
                + Mark the swap type as `Fail`.
                + Skip to next image.
        + No:
            + Mark the swap type as `None`.
            + Skip to the next image.

+  Loop 2. Iterate over all images
    1. Does the current image depend on other images?
        + Yes: Are all the image dependencies satisfied?
            + Yes: Skip to the next image.
            + No:
                + Modify the swap type depending on what the previous type
                  was.
                + Restart dependency check from the first image.
        + No: Skip to next image.

+  Loop 3. Iterate over all images
    1. Is an image swap requested?
        + Yes:
            + Perform image update operation.
            + Persist completion of swap procedure to image trailers.
            + Skip to next image.
        + No: Skip to next image.
+  Loop 4. Iterate over all images
    1. Validate the image in the primary slot (integrity and security
       check) or at least do a basic sanity check to avoid booting into an
       empty flash memory area.

+ Boot into the image in the primary slot of the 0th image position (the
  other image in the boot chain is started by another image).

### [Multiple image boot for RAM loading and direct-xip](#multiple-image-boot-for-ram-loading-and-direct-xip)

The operation of the bootloader is different when the ram-load or the
direct-xip strategy is chosen. The flash map is very similar to the swap
strategy but there is no need for a scratch area.

+  Loop 1. Until all images are loaded and all dependencies are satisfied
    1. Subloop 1. Iterate over all images
        + Does any of the slots contain an image?
            + Yes:
                + Choose the newer image.
                + Copy it to RAM in case of ram-load strategy.
                + Validate the image (integrity and security check).
                + If validation fails delete the image from flash and try
                  the other slot. (Image must be deleted from RAM too in
                  case of ram-load strategy.)
            + No: Return with failure.

    2. Subloop 2. Iterate over all images
        + Does the current image depend on other images?
            + Yes: Are all the image dependencies satisfied?
                + Yes: Skip to the next image.
                + No:
                    + Delete the image from RAM in case of ram-load
                      strategy, but do not delete it from flash.
                    + Try to load the image from the other slot.
                    + Restart dependency check from the first image.
            + No: Skip to next image.

+  Loop 2. Iterate over all images
    + Increase the security counter if needed.
    + Do the measured boot and the data sharing if needed.

+ Boot the loaded slot of image 0.

## [Image swapping](#image-swapping)

The bootloader swaps the content of the two image slots for two reasons:

* The user has issued a "set pending" operation. The image in the
  secondary slot should be run once (state I) or repeatedly (state II),
  depending on whether a permanent swap was specified.
* The test image gets rebooted without being confirmed. The bootloader
  should revert to the original image currently in the secondary slot (state
  III).

If the image trailers indicate that the image in the secondary slot should
be run, the bootloader needs to copy it to the primary slot. The image
currently in the primary slot also needs to be retained in the flash
memory so that it can be used later. Furthermore, both images need to be
recoverable if the bootloader resets in the middle of the swap operation.
The two images are swapped according to the following procedure:

1. Determine if both slots are compatible enough to have their images
   swapped. To be compatible, both have to have only sectors that can fit
   into the scratch area and if one of them has larger sectors than the
   other, it must be able to entirely fit some rounded number of sectors from
   the other slot. In the next steps, we'll use the terminology "region" for
   the total amount of data copied or erased because this can be any amount
   of sectors depending on how many the scratch can fit for some swap
   operation.

2. Iterate the list of region indices in descending order (namely,
   starting with the greatest index). Only regions that are predetermined to
   be part of the image are copied (current element = "index").
    + a. Erase scratch area.
    + b. Copy the secondary_slot[index] to scratch area.
        - If this is the last region in the slot, the scratch area has a
          temporary status area initialized to store the initial state,
          because the primary slot's last region will have to be erased. In
          this case, only the data that was calculated to the amount to the
          image is copied.
        - Else if this is the first swapped region but not the last region
          in the slot, initialize the status area in the primary slot and
          copy the full region content.
        - Else, copy the entire region content.
    + c. Write the updated swap status (i).
    + d. Erase the secondary_slot[index]
    + e. Copy the primary_slot[index] to the secondary_slot[index]
         according to the amount previosly copied at step b.
        - If this is not the last region in the slot, erase the trailer in
          the secondary slot, to always use the one in the primary slot.
    + f. Write the updated swap status (ii).
    + g. Erase the primary_slot[index].
    + h. Copy scratch area to primary_slot[index] according to the amount
         previously copied at step b.
        - If this is the last region in the slot, the status is read from
          the scratch area (where it was stored temporarily) and written
          anew in the primary slot.
    + i. Write the updated swap status (iii).

3. Persist on the completion of the swap procedure to the primary slot
image trailer.

The additional caveats in step 2f are necessary so that the secondary slot
image trailer can be written by the user at a later time. With the image
trailer unwritten, the user can test the image in the secondary slot
(namely, transition to state I).

---
***Note***

*If the region being copied contains the last sector, then the swap status*
*is temporarily maintained on the scratch area for the duration of this*
*operation. Otherwise, it always uses the primary slot's area.*

---
***Note***

*The bootloader tries to copy only used sectors (based on the largest*
*image installed on any of the slots), minimizing the number of sectors*
*copied and reducing the amount of time required for a swap operation.*

---

The particulars of step 3 vary depending on whether an image is being
tested, permanently used, reverted, or a validation failure of the
secondary slot happened when a swap was requested:

```
    * test:
        o Write primary_slot.copy_done = 1
        (swap caused the following values to be written:
            primary_slot.magic = BOOT_MAGIC
            secondary_slot.magic = UNSET
            primary_slot.image_ok = Unset)

    * permanent:
        o Write primary_slot.copy_done = 1
        (swap caused the following values to be written:
            primary_slot.magic = BOOT_MAGIC
            secondary_slot.magic = UNSET
            primary_slot.image_ok = 0x01)

    * revert:
        o Write primary_slot.copy_done = 1
        o Write primary_slot.image_ok = 1
        (swap caused the following values to be written:
            primary_slot.magic = BOOT_MAGIC)

    * failure to validate the secondary slot:
        o Write primary_slot.image_ok = 1
```

After completing the operations as described above, the image in the
primary slot is booted.

## [Swap status](#swap-status)

The swap status region allows the bootloader to recover in case it
restarts in the middle of an image swap operation. The swap status region
consists of a series of single-byte records. These records are written
independently, and therefore must be padded according to the minimum write
size imposed by the flash hardware.

The structure of the swap status region is illustrated below. In this
figure, a `min-write-size` of 1 is assumed for simplicity.

```
     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |sec127,state 0 |sec127,state 1 |sec127,state 2 |sec126,state 0 |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |sec126,state 1 |sec126,state 2 |sec125,state 0 |sec125,state 1 |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |sec125,state 2 |                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                               +
    ~                                                               ~
    ~               [Records for indices 124 through 1              ~
    ~                                                               ~
    ~               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    ~               |sec000,state 0 |sec000,state 1 |sec000,state 2 |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

As described in the picture, each image slot is partitioned into a
sequence of flash memory sectors.

If we were to enumerate the sectors in a single slot, starting at 0, we
would have a list of sector indices. Since there are two image slots, each
sector index would correspond to a pair of sectors. For example, sector
index 0 corresponds to the first sector in the primary slot and the first
sector in the secondary slot. Finally, reverse the list of indices such
that the list starts with index `BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS - 1` and ends with
0. The swap status region is a representation of this reversed list.

During a swap operation, each sector index transitions through four
separate states:

```
0. primary slot: image 0,   secondary slot: image 1,   scratch: N/A
1. primary slot: image 0,   secondary slot: N/A,       scratch: image 1 (1->s, erase 1)
2. primary slot: N/A,       secondary slot: image 0,   scratch: image 1 (0->1, erase 0)
3. primary slot: image 1,   secondary slot: image 0,   scratch: N/A     (s->0)
```

Each time a sector index transitions to a new state, the bootloader writes
a record to the swap status region. Logically, the bootloader only needs
one record per sector index to keep track of the current swap state.
However, due to limitations imposed by the flash hardware, a record cannot
be overwritten when an index's state changes. To solve this problem, the
bootloader uses three records per sector index rather than just one.

Each sector-state pair is represented as a set of three records. The
record values map to the above four states as follows:

```
            | rec0 | rec1 | rec2
    --------+------+------+------
    state 0 | 0xff | 0xff | 0xff
    state 1 | 0x01 | 0xff | 0xff
    state 2 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0xff
    state 3 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03
```

The swap status region can accommodate `BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS` sector
indices. Hence, the size of the region, in bytes, is obtained by the
following multiplication: `BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS * min-write-size * 3`.

The only requirement for the index count is that it must be large enough
to account for a maximum-sized image (namely, at least as large as the
total sector count in an image slot). If a device's image slots have been
configured with `BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS: 128` and use less than 128 sectors,
the first record that gets written will be somewhere in the middle of the
region. For example, if a slot uses 64 sectors, the first sector index
that gets swapped is 63, which corresponds to the exact halfway point
within the region.

---
***Note***

*Since the scratch area only needs to record the swapping of the last*
*sector, it uses at most `min-write-size * 3` bytes for its own status*
*area.*

---

## [Reset recovery](#reset-recovery)

If the bootloader resets in the middle of a swap operation, the two images
may be discontiguous in flash. Bootutil recovers from this condition by
using the image trailers to determine how the image parts are distributed
in flash.

First, it determines where the relevant swap status region is located.
Because this region is embedded within the image slots, its location in
the flash memory changes during a swap operation.

The set of tables shown below maps image trailers content to swap status
location. In these tables, the `source` field indicates where the swap
status region is located:

- If the swap status is found on the scratch area then it might not belong
  to the current image. The swap_info field of the swap status stores the
  corresponding image number.

- If it does not match then `source: none` is returned.

In the case of a multi-image boot, the images' primary area and the single
scratch area are always examined in pairs.

```
              | primary slot | scratch      |
    ----------+--------------+--------------|
        magic | Good         | Any          |
    copy-done | 0x01         | N/A          |
    ----------+--------------+--------------'
    source: none                            |
    ----------------------------------------'

              | primary slot | scratch      |
    ----------+--------------+--------------|
        magic | Good         | Any          |
    copy-done | 0xff         | N/A          |
    ----------+--------------+--------------'
    source: primary slot                    |
    ----------------------------------------'

              | primary slot | scratch      |
    ----------+--------------+--------------|
        magic | Any          | Good         |
    copy-done | Any          | N/A          |
    ----------+--------------+--------------'
    source: scratch                         |
    ----------------------------------------'

              | primary slot | scratch      |
    ----------+--------------+--------------|
        magic | Unset        | Any          |
    copy-done | 0xff         | N/A          |
    ----------+--------------+--------------|
    source: primary slot                    |
    ----------------------------------------+------------------------------+
    This represents one of two cases:                                      |
    o No swaps ever (no status to read, so no harm in checking).           |
    o Mid-revert; status in the primary slot.                              |
    For this reason, we assume the primary slot as source, to trigger a    |
    check of the status area and find out if there was swapping underway.  |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------'
```

- If the swap status region indicates that the images are not contiguous,
  MCUboot determines the type of swap operation that was interrupted by
  reading the `swap info` field in the active image trailer and extracting
  the swap type from bits 0-3. Then, it resumes the operation. In other
  words, it applies the procedure defined in the previous section, moving
  image 1 into the primary slot and image 0 into the secondary slot.

- If the boot status indicates that an image part is present in the
  scratch area, this part is copied into the correct location by starting at
  step e or step h in the area-swap procedure, depending on whether the part
  belongs to image 0 or image 1.

After the swap operation has been completed, the bootloader proceeds as if
it had just been started.

## [Integrity check](#integrity-check)

An image is checked for integrity immediately before it gets copied into
the primary slot. If the bootloader doesn't perform an image swap, then it
can perform an optional integrity check of the image in the primary slot
if `MCUBOOT_VALIDATE_PRIMARY_SLOT` is set, otherwise, it doesn't perform
an integrity check.

During the integrity check, the bootloader verifies the following aspects of an image:

  * The 32-bit magic number must be correct (`IMAGE_MAGIC`).
  * The image must contain an `image_tlv_info` struct, identified by its
    magic (`IMAGE_TLV_PROT_INFO_MAGIC` or `IMAGE_TLV_INFO_MAGIC`) exactly
    following the firmware (`hdr_size` + `img_size`). If
    `IMAGE_TLV_PROT_INFO_MAGIC` is found, then, after `ih_protect_tlv_size`
    bytes, another `image_tlv_info` with magic equal to `IMAGE_TLV_INFO_MAGIC`
    must be present.
  * The image must contain a SHA256 TLV.
  * The calculated SHA256 must match SHA256 TLV content.
  * The image *may* contain a signature TLV. If it does, it must also have a
    KEYHASH TLV with the hash of the key that was used to sign. The list of
    keys will then be iterated over looking for the matching key, which then
    will be used to verify the image content.

## [Security](#security)

As indicated above, the final step of the integrity check is the signature
verification. The bootloader can have one or more public keys embedded in
it at build time. During signature verification, the bootloader verifies
that an image was signed with a private key that corresponds to the
embedded KEYHASH TLV.

For information on embedding public keys in the bootloader, as well as
producing signed images, see [imgtool](imgtool.md).

If you want to enable and use encrypted images, see [encrypted
images](encrypted_images.md).

*Image encryption is not supported when the direct-xip or the ram-load*
*upgrade strategy is selected.*

### [Using hardware keys for verification](#hw-key-support)

By default, the whole public key is embedded in the bootloader code and
its hash is added to the image manifest as a KEYHASH TLV entry. As an
alternative, the bootloader can be made independent of the keys by setting
the `MCUBOOT_HW_KEY` option. In this case, the hash of the public key must
be provisioned to the target device and MCUboot must be able to retrieve
the key-hash from there. For this reason the target must provide a
definition for the `boot_retrieve_public_key_hash()` function which is
declared in `boot/bootutil/include/bootutil/sign_key.h`. It is also
required to use the `full` option for the `--public-key-format` imgtool
argument to add the whole public key (PUBKEY TLV) to the image manifest
instead of its hash (KEYHASH TLV).

During the boot, the public key is validated before being used for
signature verification. MCUboot calculates the hash of the public key from
the TLV area and compares it with the key hash that was retrieved from the
device. This way MCUboot is independent of the public key(s). The key(s)
can be provisioned at any time and by different parties.

## [Protected TLVs](#protected-tlvs)

If the TLV area contains protected TLV entries, by beginning with a
`struct image_tlv_info` with a magic value of `IMAGE_TLV_PROT_INFO_MAGIC`,
then the data of those TLVs must also be integrity and authenticity
protected. Beyond the full size of the protected TLVs being stored in the
`image_tlv_info`, the size of the protected TLVs is also saved, together
with the size of the `image_tlv_info` struct itself, in the
`ih_protected_size` field inside the header.

Whenever an image has protected TLVs, the SHA256 has to be calculated, not
just over the image header and the image, but also over the TLV info
header and the protected TLVs.

```
A +---------------------+
  | Header              | <- struct image_header
  +---------------------+
  | Payload             |
  +---------------------+
  | TLV area            |
  | +-----------------+ |    struct image_tlv_info with
  | | TLV area header | | <- IMAGE_TLV_PROT_INFO_MAGIC (optional)
  | +-----------------+ |
  | | Protected TLVs  | | <- Protected TLVs (struct image_tlv)
B | +-----------------+ |
  | | TLV area header | | <- struct image_tlv_info with IMAGE_TLV_INFO_MAGIC
C | +-----------------+ |
  | | SHA256 hash     | | <- hash from A - B (struct image_tlv)
D | +-----------------+ |
  | | Keyhash         | | <- indicates which pub. key for sig (struct image_tlv)
  | +-----------------+ |
  | | Signature       | | <- signature from C - D (struct image_tlv), only hash
  | +-----------------+ |
  +---------------------+
```

## [Dependency check](#dependency-check)

MCUboot can handle multiple firmware images. It is possible to update them
independently but, in many cases, it can be desired to be able to describe
dependencies between the images (namely to ensure API compliance and avoid
interoperability issues).

The dependencies between images can be described with additional TLV
entries, located in the protected TLV area after the end of an image.
There can be more than one dependency entry but, in practice, if the
platform only supports two individual images, then there can be a maximum
of one entry that refers to the other image.

At the phase of dependency check, all aborted swaps are finalized, if
there were any. During the dependency check, the bootloader verifies
whether the image dependencies are all satisfied. If at least one of the
dependencies of an image is not fulfilled, the swap type of that image has
to be modified accordingly and the dependency check needs to be restarted.
This way the number of unsatisfied dependencies will decrease or remain
the same. There is always at least 1 valid configuration. In the worst
case, the system returns to the initial state after the dependency check.

For more information on adding dependency entries to an image, see [Image
tools](imgtool.md).

## [Downgrade prevention](#downgrade-prevention)

Downgrade prevention is a feature that enforces that the new image must
have a higher version or security counter number than the image it is
replacing, thus preventing the malicious downgrading of the device to an
older and possibly vulnerable version of its firmware.

### [Software-based downgrade prevention](#sw-downgrade-prevention)

During the software-based downgrade prevention, the image version numbers
are compared. This feature is enabled with the
`MCUBOOT_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION` option. In this case, downgrade prevention
is only available when the overwrite-based image update strategy is used
(namely `MCUBOOT_OVERWRITE_ONLY` is set).

### [Hardware-based downgrade prevention](#hw-downgrade-prevention)

Each signed image can contain a security counter in its protected TLV
area, which can be added to the image using the `-s` option of the
[imgtool](imgtool.md) script. During the hardware-based downgrade
prevention (also called rollback protection) the new image's security
counter will be compared with the currently active security counter value,
which must be stored in a non-volatile and trusted component of the
device. It is beneficial to handle this counter independently from the
image version number:

  - It does not need to increase with each software release.
  - It makes it possible to do software downgrade to some extent: if the
    security counter has the same value in the older image, then it is
    accepted.

It is an optional step of the image validation process and can be enabled
with the `MCUBOOT_HW_ROLLBACK_PROT` config option. When enabled, the
target must provide an implementation of the interface of the security
counter defined in `boot/bootutil/include/security_cnt.h`.

## [Measured boot and data sharing](#boot-data-sharing)

MCUBoot defines both a mechanism for sharing boot status information (also
known as measured boot) and an interface for sharing application-specific
information with the runtime software. If any of these mechanisms are
enabled, the target must provide a shared data area between the bootloader
and the runtime firmware and define the following parameters:

```c
#define MCUBOOT_SHARED_DATA_BASE    <area_base_addr>
#define MCUBOOT_SHARED_DATA_SIZE    <area_size_in_bytes>
```

In the shared memory area all data entries are stored in a
type-length-value (TLV) format. Before adding the first data entry, the
whole area is overwritten with zeros and a TLV header is added at the
beginning of the area during the initialization phase. This TLV header
contains a `tlv_magic` field with a value of `SHARED_DATA_TLV_INFO_MAGIC`
and a `tlv_tot_len` field which is indicating the total length of the
shared TLV area including this header.

The header is followed by the data TLV entries which are composed of a
`shared_data_tlv_entry` header and the data itself. In the data header,
there is a `tlv_type` field that identifies the consumer of the entry (in
the runtime software) and specifies the subtype of that data item.

More information about the `tlv_type` field and data types can be found in
the `boot/bootutil/include/bootutil/boot_status.h` file.

The type is followed by a `tlv_len` field which indicates the size of the
data entry in bytes, not including the entry header. After this header
structure comes the actual data.

```c
/** Shared data TLV header.  All fields in little endian. */
struct shared_data_tlv_header {
    uint16_t tlv_magic;
    uint16_t tlv_tot_len; /* size of whole TLV area (including this header) */
};

/** Shared data TLV entry header format. All fields in little endian. */
struct shared_data_tlv_entry {
    uint16_t tlv_type;
    uint16_t tlv_len; /* TLV data length (not including this header). */
};
```

The measured boot can be enabled with the `MCUBOOT_MEASURED_BOOT` config
option. When enabled, the `--boot_record` argument of the imgtool script
must also be used during the image signing process to add a BOOT_RECORD
TLV to the image manifest. This TLV contains the following
attributes/measurements of the image in CBOR encoded format:

  * Software type (role of the software component)
  * Software version
  * Signer ID (identifies the signing authority)
  * Measurement value (hash of the image)
  * Measurement type (algorithm used to calculate the measurement value)

The `sw_type` string that is passed as the `--boot_record` option's
parameter will be the value of the "Software type" attribute in the
generated BOOT_RECORD TLV. The target must also define the
`MAX_BOOT_RECORD_SZ` macro which indicates the maximum size of the
CBOR-encoded boot record in bytes. During the boot, MCUBoot looks for
these TLVs (in case of multiple images) in the manifests of the active
images (the latest and validated) and copies the CBOR-encoded binary data
to the shared data area. Preserving all these image attributes from the
boot stage for use by later runtime services (such as an attestation
service) is known as a measured boot.

Setting the `MCUBOOT_DATA_SHARING` option enables the sharing of
application-specific data using the same shared data area, as for the
measured boot. For this, the target must provide a definition for the
`boot_save_shared_data()` function which is declared in
`boot/bootutil/include/bootutil/boot_record.h`. The
`boot_add_data_to_shared_area()` function can be used for adding new TLV
entries to the shared data area.

## [Testing Fault Injection Hardening (FIH) in CI](#testing-fih-in-ci)

The CI currently tests the Fault Injection Hardening feature of MCUboot by
executing instruction skip during execution, and looking at whether a
corrupted image was booted by the bootloader or not.

The main idea is that instruction skipping can be automated by scripting a
debugger to automatically execute the following steps:

- Set breakpoint at the specified address.
- Continue execution.
- On breakpoint hit to increase the Program Counter.
- Continue execution.
- Detach from the target after a timeout reached.

Whether or not the corrupted image was booted or not can be decided by
looking for certain entries in the log.

As MCUboot is deployed on a microcontroller, testing FI would not make
much sense in the simulator environment running on a host machine with a
different architecture than the MCU's, as the degree of hardening depends
on the compiler behavior. For example, (a bit counterintuitively) the code
produced by gcc with `-O0` optimization is more resilient against FI
attacks than the code generated with `-O3` or `-Os` optimizations.

To run on the desired architecture in the CI, the tests need to be
executed on an emulator (as real devices are not available in the CI
environment). For this implementation, QEMU is selected.

For the tests, MCUboot needs a set of drivers and an implementation of the
main function. For this test, Trusted-Firmware-M has been selected as it
supports Armv8-M platforms that are also emulated by QEMU.

The tests run in a docker container inside the CI VMs, to make it easier
to deploy, build, and test environments (QEMU, compilers, interpreters).
The CI VMs seem to be using a relatively old version of Ubuntu (16.04).

The sequence of the testing is the following (pseudo code):

```sh
fn main()
  # Implemented in ci/fih-tests_install.sh
  generate_docker_image(Dockerfile)

  # See details below. Implemented in ci/fih-tests_run.sh.
  # Calling the function with different parameters is done by Travis CI based on
  # the values provided in the .travis.yaml
  start_docker_image(skip_sizes, build_type, damage_type, fih_level)

fn start_docker_image(skip_sizes, build_type, damage_type, fih_level)
  # implemented in ci/fih_test_docker/execute_test.sh
  compile_mcuboot(build_type)

  # implemented in ci/fih_test_docker/damage_image.py
  damage_image(damage_type)

  # implemented in ci/fih_test_docker/run_fi_test.sh
  ranges = generate_address_ranges()
  for s in skip_sizes
    for r in ranges
      do_skip_in_qemu(s, r) # See details below
  evaluate_logs()

fn do_skip_in_qemu(size, range)
  for a in r
    run_qemu(a, size)  # See details below

# this part is implemented in ci/fih_test_docker/fi_tester_gdb.sh
fn run_qemu(a, size)
  script = create_debugger_script(a, size)
  start_qemu_in_bacground() # logs serial out to a file
  gdb_attach_to_qemu(script)
  kill_qemu()

  # This checks the debugger and the QEMU logs, and decides whether the test
  # was executed successfully, and whether the image is booted or not. Then
  # emits a yaml fragment on the standard out to be processed by the caller
  # script
  evaluate_run(qemu_log_file)
```

Further notes:

- The image is corrupted by changing its signature.

- `MCUBOOT_FIH_PROFILE_MAX` is not tested as it requires TRNG, and the
  AN521 platform has no support for it. However, this profile adds the
  random execution delay to the code, so should not affect the instruction
  skip results too much, because the breakpoint is placed at the exact
  address. But, in practice, this makes harder the accurate timing of the
  attack.

- The test cases defined in `.travis.yml` always return `passed`, if they
  were executed successfully. A yaml file is created during the test
  execution with the details of the test execution results. A summary of the
  collected results is printed in the log at the end of the test.

  An advantage of having the tests running in a docker image is that it is
  possible to run the tests on a local machine that has git and docker,
  without installing any additional software.

  So, running the test on the host looks like the following (the commands
  below are issued from the MCUboot source directory):

  ```sh
  $ ./ci/fih-tests_install.sh
  $ FIH_LEVEL=MCUBOOT_FIH_PROFILE_MEDIUM BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE SKIP_SIZE=2 \
      DAMAGE_TYPE=SIGNATURE ./ci/fih-tests_run.sh
  ```

  On the travis CI, the environment variables in the last command are set
  based on the configs provided in the `.travis.yml`

  This starts the tests, however, the shell that it is running in is not
  interactive. As such, it is not possible to examine the results of the
  test run. To have an interactive shell where the results can be examined,
  do the following:

- The docker image needs to be built with `ci/fih-tests_install.sh`, as
  described above.

- Start the docker image with the following command:
  `docker run -i -t mcuboot/fih-test`.

- Execute the test with a command similar to the following:
  `/root/execute_test.sh 8 RELEASE SIGNATURE MEDIUM`. After the test
  finishes, the shell returns, and it is possible to investigate the
  results. It is also possible to stop the test with _Ctrl+C_. The
  parameters to the `execute_test.sh` are, in order, `SKIP_SIZE`,
  `BUILD_TYPE`, `DAMAGE_TYPE`, and `FIH_LEVEL`.
