  Responsibilities:

  A typical day for Inaya is spent integrating and sustaining integration of 10+ closely related products developed over the last 5 years. Each product requires an immutable boot loader and an application image. Some may require multi-stage boot.

  - Having to integrate, verify and release security fixes for the entire set of products within a couple weeks.

  Goals:

  - Getting the job done right the first time so security, safety, and/or feature issues do not escape to the field.
  - Having thorough objective evidence that immutable boot code is complete, correct, and meets the security standard chosen by her business.

  Influences:

  - The Engineering architect setting technical direction for the business.
  - The open source projects being integrated into her product.
