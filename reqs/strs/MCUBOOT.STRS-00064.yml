  As a Firmware Integration Engineer using MCU with a lockable boot flash partition too small for my full set of boot functionality,
  I need the bootloader source to be configurable as a minimal, immutable first stage image and configurable as a full-featured second-stage bootloader image,
  so the MCU constraint can boot my application.
